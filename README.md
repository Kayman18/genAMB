# genAMB FM-1 — 1.0 RC2

Custom firmware for the FM-1. 

It will start in PIANO mode (this mode will let you play Rings or the FM synth Via the Keybed. Depending on Which one you have selected), only the Pad synths will run. Turn the Algorithm knob to place it in scale mode and have the sequencers trigger notes.

*  2 Pad Synths (Both have different Characters Pad 1 - Vintage and Rhodes. Pad 2 - Strings and Glass. Pad 1 has a Chorus Effect, Pad 2 has a Stereo Width setting (cpu maxing out)
*  Rings port - Modes Kept - Modal, Sympathetic stings, and Strings the rest had to go for space and memory
*  6Voice FM synth, with 16 Presets - Koto, Harp, Brt Harp, Drop, Mallet, Bell, Rin, Bamboo, Furin, Marimba, Celeste, Kalimba, Xylophone, Glockenspiel, Warm Bass, Reso Bass.
*  3 Ported Sequencers from VCVrack: Hallucigenia, Proteus, UNIT-D
*  Burst Setting, to simulate Chords strums
*  Delay on Rings (too costly to add everywhere, may try to add it to FM later)
*  Global 4 Channel Mixer

- **Proteus** — adapted from [Seaside Modular Proteus](https://github.com/abluenautilus/SeasideModularVCV/blob/master/src/Proteus.cpp), by Seaside Modular contributors (MIT).
- **UNIT-D / UnitDistanceSeq** — adapted from [Animatek's UNIT-D](https://github.com/animatek/UZZ-VCV-RACK/blob/main/src/UnitDistanceSeq.cpp); the adaptation is GPL-3.0-or-later.
